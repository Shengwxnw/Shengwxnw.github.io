Worker Integration Report

Summary
- Your configured Worker endpoint https://router-worker-edge.zihaofu12.workers.dev responds correctly to both /p and /fetch, returns 200, streams bodies, and exposes the expected headers including Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *.
- The GitHub repository you linked (https://github.com/ZihaoFU245/cf-worker-router) does not match that deployed Worker: it only implements POST /magic and returns 404 for other routes. It is not the repo that produced the deployed service.

Findings
- Deployed Worker:
  - GET /p?sid=test&u=base64url(https://example.com) → 200 OK with HTML bytes.
  - POST /fetch with { sid, target: https://example.com, method: GET } → 200 OK, Content-Type: text/html, CORS allow: *.
- Linked repo (cf-worker-router):
  - worker.js handles only POST /magic (expects body { key }) and returns a JSON response.
  - For any other path, returns 404 JSON. There is no /p or /fetch implementation, no header filtering or Range support per the contract.

Impact
- If you deploy the linked repo to Cloudflare Workers, the Connector’s requests to /p and /fetch will 404 and the app will not function.
- Your currently running Worker is a different codebase (or different branch/repo) that matches the specified contract — this is good. Keep using that for the Connector.

Recommendation
- Confirm the source repo of the deployed Worker that serves /p and /fetch. Ensure that repository includes:
  - GET /p with Range passthrough.
  - POST /fetch handling JSON control-plane.
  - CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin to Connector origin (or *), and Access-Control-Expose-Headers including: Content-Type, Content-Length, Accept-Ranges, Content-Range, ETag, Last-Modified, X-Set-Cookie.
- Update the README of the linked repo or replace the link to the correct Worker repository to avoid confusion.

Connector-side fix applied
- The Connector was not registering the Service Worker correctly on GitHub Pages, so /fetch and /p were not being rewritten to your Worker. I fixed this by:
  - Adding a static Service Worker file at public/proxy-sw.js and registering it at /proxy-sw.js, which is correctly served in production builds.
  - Keeping the Configure button to set the Worker URL at runtime and warming up the connection.
  - Improving UI error handling so failed requests show an error message instead of appearing as “nothing happened.”
